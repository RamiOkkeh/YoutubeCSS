# YoutubeCSS

This is my attempt to replicate the [_Youtube_](https://youtube.com/) user interface

## Description

For this project I attempted to re-create youtubes interface with as much detail as I could,
this is mostly just an interface design with very minimal interactive elements, although it does implement dynamicly generated user comments that were generated using a Machine learning algorithm that generates random persons.

This project was my first experience working with CSS, it turned out looking pretty good, and it motivated me to spend more time polishing the interface of my future projects.
