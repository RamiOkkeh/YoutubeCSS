## Description

for this project i attempted to recreate youtubes interface with as much detail as i could,
this is mostly just an interface design with very minimal interactive elements, although it does implement dynamicly generated user comments that were generated using a Machine learning algorithm that generates random persons.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [TPDNE](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) for generating user profiles
