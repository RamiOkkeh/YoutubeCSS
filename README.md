## Description

For this project I attempted to re-create youtubes interface with as much detail as I could,
this is mostly just an interface design with very minimal interactive elements, although it does implement dynamicly generated user comments that were generated using a Machine learning algorithm that generates random persons.
<br/>
<br/>
This project was my first experience working with CSS, it turned out looking pretty good, and it motivated me to spend more time polishing the interface of my future projects.

## Technologies

- CSS used to style the interface
- JavaScript used to generating random video recommendations and user comments, also handling comment functionality
- [TPDNE](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) for generating user profiles
